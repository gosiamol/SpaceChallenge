ART 3: Running the Simulation
Create a Main class with the main method and start running the simulation:

Create a Simulation object
Load Items for Phase-1 and Phase-2
Load a fleet of U1 rockets for Phase-1 and then for Phase-2
Run the simulation using the fleet of U1 rockets and display the total budget required.
Repeat the same for U2 rockets and display the total budget for that.*/
